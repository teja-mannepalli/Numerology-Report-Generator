# Numerology-Report-Generator
Numerology Report generator
This Python project will generate the 'numerology report' of the corresponding details entered in a text file.
The name of the text file will be the name of the person entered. If the same name of the already existing file is provided the old text file will be replaced.
Kindly set the path of the directory to which the text files are to be saved.
Change the path value of variable 'save_path' (Line 7) in 'main.py'.


Ex: "D:\ \Documents_Sep2020\ \Python_code_results\ \NumerologyReports"            
not,  "D:\Documents_Sep2020\Python_code_results\NumerologyReports"

Kindly note the path with double backlash "\\ \\" and not single backslash "\\". (No spaces in between)


While entering the details, enter 'Day', 'Month', and 'Year' in number format.
Ex:- 

       Day:      13
       
       Month:    04
       
       Year:     1994
       
       Name:     Abc D Efgh
